# READ ME

this is a temporaty README. It will be later revamped to its final form.

- File queries_films.py makes consecutive Get-requests to dbpedia in order to get a list of movies with a single director, producer, music composer and actor (relationship :starring) to it associated. The result is the file films.json in the directory filmjsons.
- There was an attempt to separate the sparql queries, so it would get directors, producers, composers and actors separately - but the attempt failed due to poor timely responses and poor computing time.
